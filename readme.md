# Outdoor blog backend

## Technologies used:
- Java and Spring/Hybernate

## The Project:
- I decided to get out of my comfort zone, and create a project using a language and framework that I had never used before! One of my goals since I first started coding was to create a blog, so I am super excited to not only have created that, but to have created that with a language and framework that is new to me!

## Struggles:
- I tried to add user authentication to this project, but ended up taking it out because it did not work, but I am going to explore that idea more, because I would like to make it where I am the only person allowed to sign in and edit/delete the blog posts.
- I also had some issues figuring out how to get my entities to connect, but I figured it out and it works great now!
